# üè° Conditional Floor Plan Generator üìê

This project implements a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic floor plans based on given text descriptions. The model is trained to learn the intricate patterns of architectural layouts and translate textual conditions into visual representations. This project is optimized for ease of use within a Google Colab environment for hackathon submission.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate floor plans from natural language descriptions.
* **Custom CGAN Architecture:** Implements a custom Generator and Discriminator tailored for image synthesis with conditional input.
* **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE):** Utilizes powerful pre-trained embeddings for robust text understanding.
* **Interactive UI:** Includes a Gradio interface for real-time demonstration and interaction.
* **Google Colab Integration:** Designed for easy setup, training, and execution in Google Colab environment, with automatic dataset and model handling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project, simply open the notebook in Google Colab and execute all cells.

### Setup and Running the Notebook

1.  **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click the "Open In Colab" badge above.
2.  **Run All Cells:** Go to `Runtime` -> `Run all` in the Colab menu. The notebook is designed to handle all installations, data downloads, and model loading automatically.
    * **Automatic Dataset Download:** The notebook is configured to automatically download the `archive (6).zip` dataset from Google Drive into your Colab environment using `gdown`. You do not need to manually download or upload it.
    * **Google Drive Mount:** The notebook will prompt you to mount your Google Drive. This is required to save/load the trained generator model.
    * **Training:** The notebook will train the CGAN for a predefined number of epochs (initially set to a small number for quick demonstration). You can modify `epochs_to_train_this_run` in the training cell if you wish to train for longer.
    * **Model Loading:** If a previously trained model exists on your Google Drive, the training cell will load it and continue training. The Gradio UI will also automatically load the latest saved model.


## üñºÔ∏è Examples & Results

*(Note: These scores reflect the similarity between generated and real images. Higher SSIM (closer to 1.0) and lower MSE (closer to 0.0) indicate better perceptual and pixel-level similarity, respectively. Expect these values to improve significantly with longer training.)*

* Experiment with different GAN architectures (e.g., StyleGAN, BigGAN).
* Incorporate more complex conditional inputs (e.g., room counts, specific dimensions).
* Explore different loss functions or regularization techniques.
* Expand the dataset with more diverse floor plan types.
